      <p class="text-justify">The mission is to promote women's institutions to bring in social justice and equality thus leading to rural transformation. We visualize an equitable society which can sustain continuous transformation in human conditions that is happening socially, economically, psychologically, politically and spiritually.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Our vision is to empower women from marginalized communities both socially and economically so that they become the catalysts of change, not only in their own lives, but also for their families and the entire community. We visualize shaping up collectives such a way so that they can become strong and independent enough to bind people together and exert a normative influence on the society.</p>
