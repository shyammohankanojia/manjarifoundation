		<h2 class="text-center">Where We Work</h2>
		<div class="col-md-12">
      <p class="text-justify">We are headquartered in Delhi but operate from the Dholpur district of Rajasthan, India. The five blocks covered at present are Bari, Baseri, Dholpur, Rajakheda, and Dausa. We have further plans of expansion to include districts of Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Rajasmand, Bheelwara, and Ajmer. This would enable us to reach out to more than 50000 rural families in the coming year. Here's a brief about the geographical locations we cover and the present social setup we are working with.</p>

      <h3 class="sub-title">Geographical location and social set up:</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">The Dholpur town is around 55 kilometers south of Agra accessible via Delhi-Gwalior national highway i.e. NH 3. The district comprises three distinct geographical areas, i.e. the plain land, the rocky Aravali plateau also known as the Daang region and the Chambal basin. While the district is intersected by ravines along the entire stretch of Chambal river, low ranges of hills form the topography of the western part. These hills are mostly known for their mines and quarries of fine-grained red sandstone. It is the presence of Aravali which primarily dictates the region's demography, topography, resources and livelihoods.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">The Dholpur district has many geographical variations which in turn dictate its social characteristics too. Itâ€™s in semi-arid region of Rajasthan having an average annual rainfall of 550 mm which is also highly scattered within the district. The region reflects an interesting mix of agriculture and non-farm sector both of which contribute to strengthen the domestic economy. While the soil is fertile but severe water shortage has retarded the growth of agriculture in this area. As an alternative many rural families have resorted to dairy and livestock farming.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">Women forming a major part of the society still remain underprivileged and ignored in Dholpur which is also evident from the fact that the district has one of the lowest sex ratio in country.</p>
